\subsection{Friction}

There are three kinds of friction:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Static friction: $\Vec{f}_s \leq \mu_s n$. Applies when object is not moving. It adjusts itself so that the net force is 0, but it can only increase to $\mu_s n$ at most.
    \item Kinetic friction: $\Vec{f}_k = \mu_r n$. Applies when object is moving.
    \item Rolling friction: $\Vec{f}_r = \mu_r n$. Applies when object is rolling.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Interacting Objects}

According to Newton's Third Law:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Every force occurs as one member of an action/reaction pair of forces.
    \item The two forces act on \textbf{different} objects.
    \item The two forces point in opposite directions and have the same magnitude.
\end{itemize}
