\subsection{Friction}

Three kinds of friction: static, kinetic, and rolling. All are proportional to normal force.

\subsubsection{Static friction}

The force of static friction is $\hat{f}_s$. Only applies when object is not moving. Self-adjusts to be equal to opposing force.
Max static friction is $\mu_s n$.

\subsubsection{Kinetic friction}

The force of kinetic friction is $\hat{f}_k = \mu_r n$. Applies when object is moving.

\subsubsection{Rolling friction}

The force of rolling friction is $\hat{f}_r = \mu_r n$. Applies when object is rolling.
