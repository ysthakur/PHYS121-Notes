\subsection{Uniform Circular Motion}

Speed is constant but not velocity, because direction is constantly changing.

Centripetal acceleration for uniform circular motion: $\displaystyle a = \frac{v^2}{r} = \paren{\frac{2\pi}{T}}^2 r$

\textbf{Period:} Time taken to go around circle one time.

\textbf{Frequency:} Number of revolutions per second: $\displaystyle f = \frac{1}{T}$ (unit is $\mathrm{s}^{-1}$)

\textbf{Angular velocity:} $\omega = 2\pi f$

\textbf{Speed:} Time taken to make one revolution: $\displaystyle v = \frac{2\pi r}{T} = 2\pi fr = r\omega$

\subsection{Dynamics of Uniform Circular Motion}

Net force producing the centripetal acceleration of uniform circular motion: $\Vec{F}_{net} = m\Vec{a}$ (towards the center of the circle)

When a car turns in a circle, static friction is the force that causes centripetal acceleration.

\subsection{Apparent Forces in Circular Motion}

Apparent weight equals normal force.

\textbf{Critical speed:} $v_c$ is the speed for which $\Vec{n} = 0$.\\
For roller coaster, $v_c = \sqrt{gr}$\\
The critical speed is the slowest speed at which the car can complete a roller coaster circle.
