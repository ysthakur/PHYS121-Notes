\subsection{Uniform Circular Motion}

Speed is constant but not velocity, because direction is constantly changing.

Centripetal acceleration for uniform circular motion:
$\displaystyle a = \frac{v^2}{r} = \paren{\frac{2\pi r}{T}}^2 r$

\textbf{Period:} Time taken to go around circle one time.

\textbf{Frequency:} Number of revolutions per second: $\displaystyle f = \frac{1}{T}$ (unit is $\mathrm{s}^{-1}$)

\textbf{Angular velocity:} $\omega = 2\pi f$

\textbf{Speed:} Time taken to make one revolution: $\displaystyle v = \frac{2\pi r}{T} = 2\pi fr = r\omega$
