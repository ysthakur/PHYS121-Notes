1. ✅ B 
2. ✅ B 
3. ✅ B 
4. ✅ D
5. ✅ A
6. ✅ A
7. ✅ B
8. ✅ C (higher Young's modulus means less strain)
9. ✅ D
10. ✅ C
11. ✅ B
12. ✅ A
13. ✅ A
14. ✅ B
15. Net force and torque must be 0
    1. ✅ 1068.2
    2. ✅ 709.43
17. ❌ 8.46 m
18. ❌ $f_s = F_W$, where $F_W$ is the normal force of the wall on the ladder \
  This can be found by setting the bottom of the ladder as the pivot point and making sure the torques cancel out
  $F_W = 768.1$ \
  Normal force of floor on ladder: $F_N = 874 + 400$ (has to cancel out the weight of the ladder and the man) \
  $f_s = mu F_N arrow mu = f_s / F_N = 0.6$
19. ✅ C
20. ✅ Left is 370 N, right is 130 N
23. ✅ A
