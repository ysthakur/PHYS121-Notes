= Chapter 10: Energy and Work

== The Basic Energy Model

Every system has a total energy $E$

=== Energy Transfers and Work

Energy can be transferred between a system and its environment through work and heat

/ Work: Mechanical transfer of energy to or from a system by pushing or pulling on it
/ Heat: Nonmechanical transfer of energy between system and environment due to temperature difference between the two

Work is change in total energy:
$ W = Delta E $

/ Isolated system: No energy transferred into or out of system

=== Law of Conservation of Energy

The total energy of an isolated system remains constant

== Work

Work is done on a system by *external forces*

$ W = F d $

Work is a *scalar* even though force and displacement are vectors

Units of work are $J$ (joules), same as energy

A force does no work on an object if the object undergoes no displacement (or the force is perpendicular to the displacement)

=== Kinetic Energy

/ Translational kinetic energy: Energy of motion in a line

$ K = 1/2 m v^2 $

/ Rotational kinetic energy: Way of expressing sum of kinetic energy of all parts of a rotating object.
  Moment of inertia takes place of mass and angular velocity takes place of linear velocity.

$ K_"rot" = 1/2 I omega^2 $

== Potential Energy

/ Conservative forces: Forces that can store useful energy, e.g. gravity, elastic forces
/ Nonconservative forces: Forces that can't store useful energy, e.g. friction

=== Gravitational Potential Energy

$ U_upright(g) = m g h $

Only the height ($h$) matters, not the path the object took to get there

=== Elastic Potential Energy

$ U_upright(s) = 1/2 k x^2 $

== Conservation of Energy
