= Chapter 8: Equilibrium and Elasticity

== Torque and Static Equilibrium

An object at rest is in *static equilibrium*.

As long as the object can be modeled as a particle, static equilibrium is achieved when the net force on the particle is 0.

However, for extended objects that can rotate, we need to also consider torque: the object is only in static equilibrium if *both net force _and_ net torque* are 0.

=== Choosing the Pivot Point

For an object in static equilibrium, the net torque about *every point* must be 0.

You can choose _any_ point as a pivot point for calculating torque.

*Natural axis:* Axis about which rotation *would* occur if the object were not in static equilibrium.

== Forces and Torques in the Body

=== Mechanical Advantage

If a nutcracker applies 3 times as much force to the nut as the force applied by the hand, it has a mechanical advantage of 3.

== Stability and Balance

An extended object has a *base of support* on which it rests when in static equilibrium.

A wider base of support and/or a lower center of gravity improves stability.

As long as the object's center of gravity remains over the base of support, torque due to gravity will rotate the object back towards its stable equilibrium position. The object is *stable*.

If the object's center of gravity moves outside the base of support, it is *unstable*.

*Critical angle:* Angle where center of gravity is directly above pivot.
