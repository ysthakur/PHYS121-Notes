== Vectors

- $A_x = A cos(theta)$ and $A_y = A sin(theta)$

$theta = tan^(-1)(A_y / A_x)$

== Projectile Motion

/ Projectile: An object that moves in 2 dimensions under the influence of gravity and nothing else
/ Launch angle: Angle of the initial velocity above the horizontal (x-axis)
/ Range: The range of Ã projectile is the horizontal distance travelled

- Horizontal direction has uniform motion
- Vertical direction has free-fall motion
- For smaller objects, air resistance is critical
  - Maximum range comes at an angle less than 45#sym.degree

== Circular Motion

/ Centripetal acceleration: Acceleration pointing towards the center of a circle

$(Delta v)/v = d/r$, where $d$ is displacement

Centripetal acceleration is $a = (v^2)/r$, towards the center of the circle

== Relative Velocity
