== Distance vs Displacement

- Distance is an absolute value, how much you travelled
- Displacement is $Delta x = "end" - "start"$
  - Path doesn't matter
  - Vector quantity

== Significant figures

- When multiplying or dividing, whichever operand had fewer significant figures, that's how many significant figures the result has
  - e.g. $3.73 dot 5.7 = 21$ (5.7 has 2 sig figs, so 21 does too)
- When adding or subtracting, whichever operand had the fewest decimal places, that's how many decimal places the result will have
  - e.g. $16.7 + 5.24 = 21.94 = 21.9$ (16.7 has 1 decimal place, so the result does too)
