== Motion and Forces

/ Newton's first law: An object willre main at rest or continue moving in a straight line at the same speed unless it has forces acting on it
/ Contact forces: Forces that act on an object by touching it
/ Long-range forces: Forces that act on an object without physical contact

Examples of forces:

- Weight ($arrow(w)$)
